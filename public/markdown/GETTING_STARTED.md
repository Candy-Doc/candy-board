# Welcome on Candy-Board

Candy-part is the front part of the Candy-Doc project.

This place allows you to visualize your project represented in a DDD graph.

If you're not familiar with the _Domain Driven Design_, we encourage you to check the [DDD tab](DDD.md).

## How to fully live the candy-board experience **?**

Your graph is available on the **Graph** tab, accessible through the top navbar.

### Manipulate the graph

You can easily **manipulate** each node by dragging them. Moving node will not
break the graph structure and will keep edges and containers unchanged.

You can **select** node groups as well by maintaining _Ctrl_. The selected nodes
will appear with a blue border. You can eventually select each node individually
by _Ctrl + click_ on each of them.

You can **expand/collapse** each cluster by _double-clicking_ on them.

### Explore the sidebar

On the left side of your screen, you can access to the sidebar.

Firstly, the book tab called **Patterns**, gather all the annotated concepts of your project.
You can expand it to view the project hierarchy.

Each node is supplied with two options that you can access by opening the pattern's popover when
clicking the 3 dots vertical icon:

- location (the target icon): Allow you to center camera on the targeted pattern
- focus (the open eye): Hide all non-neighbors nodes of the targeted pattern.

A serchbar is also provided to filter the patterns and easily find what you are looking for.

Then, the paint palette is the **Legend**, you'll be able to recognize the concept of each node by its
representation.

Finally, the **Tools** tab displays 4 buttons.

- **Fit view** to fit your view on the graph.
- **Reset** to generate again the graph.
- **Download SVG** to download the graph on SVG format.
- **View SVG** to open the graph on an SVG format on a new blank tab.

The **Legend** and **Tools** tabs are both featuring a sticky mode.
You can enable it by clickink on the bookmark icon positioned at the right of the line. It allows you
for instance to keep view on the legend while checking on the patterns.
