# WELCOME ON CANDY-BOARD

Candy-part is the front part of the Candy-Doc project.

This place allows you to visualize your project represented in a DDD graph.

If you're not familiar with the _Domain Driven Design_, we encourage you to check the [DDD tab](DDD.md).

## How to fully live the candy-board experience **?**

Your graph is available on the **Graph** tab, accessible through the top navbar.

### Manipulate the graph

You can easily **manipulate** each node by dragging them. Moving node will not
break the graph structure and will keep edges and containers unchanged.

You can **select** node groups as well by maintaining _Ctrl_. The selected nodes
will appear with a blue border. You can eventually select each node individually
by _Ctrl + click_ on each of them.

You can **expand/collapse** each cluster by _double-clicking_ on them.

### Explore the sidebar

On the left side of your screen, you can access to the sidebar.

Firstly, the book tab called **Patterns**, gather all the annotated concepts of your project.
You can expand it to view the project hierarchy. Each node is supplied with a location (the target icon)
and focus (the opened eye) buttons.

Then, the paint palette is the **Legend**, you'll be able to recognize the concept of each node by its
representation.

Finally, the **Tools** tab displays 4 buttons.

- **Fit view** to fit your view on the graph.
- **Reset** to generate again the graph.
- **Download SVG** to download the graph on SVG format.
- **View SVG** to open the graph on an SVG format on a new blank tab.
