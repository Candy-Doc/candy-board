## Fix bugs by creating PR's

We appreciate every time you report a bug in the product. However, taking time to submit a PR can help us in fixing bugs quickly and ensure a healthy and stable eco-system.

Go through the following points, before creating a new PR.

1. Create an issue discussing the bug.
2. Once approved, go ahead and fork the REPO.
3. Make sure to start from the `main`, since this is the up-to-date branch.
4. Make sure to keep commits small and relevant.
5. Follow [our git commit message convention](#Git-Commit-Messages).
6. Once done with all the changes, create a PR against the `main` branch.
